* Config file should be a go file, not a yaml file if all variables are static
* Use submodules for driver so that you dont have to link your github
* The request assigner shouldnt be in the same folder as the single elevator, make a new controller or assigner folder
* preferred0rders sorts elevators based on time to Idle, creative and heuristic way to assign orders
* Code lacks persistent error handeling, wrap in if err != nil { log.Println("Error:", err) }
* Be consistent with name conventions, you have them mixed up quite a lot e.g newpeer() vs newElevator(), SendMsg() vs sendLifeSignal()).
* In the timeout() function, readLifeSignals() might try to acqire peersLock, leading to a deadlock, maybe its safer to use defer to assure Unock() is called even if errors occur

* Should split code into packages, now all the code is in main.go
* Single letter variable names some places makes it a bit hard to understand
* Should have a README.md or atleast add how to use the code to doc.txt
* Suggest using some automatic way of assigning id like either ip-address or pid-id
* Missing some config to keep track of global variables like numfloor and numbuttons
* Good use of channels
* FSM, Requests and elevator.go looks good
