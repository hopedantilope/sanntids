* Config file should be a go file, not a yaml file
* Use submodules for driver so that you dont have to link your github
* The request assigner shouldnt be in the same folder as the single elevator, make a new controller or assigner folder

Good modularisation, each module focuses on a single responsibility
Descriptive names and comments makes the code understandable, however adding some informations to the README would help
The main function clearly shows what threads and are initialized and how they interact. 
Good use of structured state objects (ElevatorState, GlobalState ...).
Some use of global variables, such as in the fsm package where functions directly modify the global variable (elevatorState) instead of using parameters and return values, so theyâ€™re not fully pure, though the global state is clearly defined and easy to track.
Overall is seems to be a robust, peer-to-peer design with clear responsibilities and effective state synchronization.

* Should split code into packages, now all the code is in main.go
* Single letter variable names some places makes it a bit hard to understand
* Should have a README.md or atleast add how to use the code to doc.txt
* Suggest using some automatic way of assigning id like either ip-address or pid-id
* Missing some config to keep track of global variables like numfloor and numbuttons
* Good use of channels
* FSM, Requests and elevator.go looks good
