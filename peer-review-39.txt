* Should split code into packages, now all the code is in main.go
* Single letter variable names some places makes it a bit hard to understand
* Should have a README.md or atleast add how to use the code to doc.txt
* Suggest using some automatic way of assigning id like either ip-address or pid-id
* Missing some config to keep track of global variables like numfloor and numbuttons
* Good use of channels
* FSM, Requests and elevator.go looks good
